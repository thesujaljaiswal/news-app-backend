## Features

- **Article Management**: CRUD operations for news articles.  
- **Category Management**: Organize news articles into various categories.  
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login (e.g., JWT-based).  
- **Search Functionality**: Search for articles by keywords, categories, or authors.  
- **Pagination & Filtering**: Efficiently retrieve large sets of articles.  
- **Admin Panel**: (Optional, if implemented) Dedicated routes for administrative tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.  
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.  
- **MongoDB / Mongoose**: NoSQL database and ODM for Node.js (or PostgreSQL/Sequelize if SQL).  
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for authentication.  
- **Bcrypt**: For password hashing.  
- **Dotenv**: For managing environment variables.  
- **Nodemon**: For automatic server restarts during development.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)  
- npm (comes with Node.js)  
- MongoDB (if using MongoDB) or PostgreSQL (if using PostgreSQL)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thesujaljaiswal/news-app-backend.git
cd news-app-backend
````

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/newsapp_db # Or your MongoDB Atlas URI
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1h
# Add other variables as needed, e.g., for API keys, cloud storage, etc.
```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode (with Nodemon):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will restart automatically on code changes.

### Production Mode:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000` (or the PORT you specified in your `.env` file).

## API Endpoints

*(This section is illustrative. You should replace it with your actual API routes and examples.)*
